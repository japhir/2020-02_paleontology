* Preparation
If you're curious about learning R, this exercise could be a fun little first
challenge!

While excel works, it often introduces problems that shouldn't be there: in
this exercise it isn't able to plot the age in millions of years ago (~Ma~) as a
~date~, because it doesn't have enough digits for conversion. As a workaround you
can convert it to ~kyr~ in stead.

That is obviously stupid. And it's not the only frustrating excel thing you may
run into. One of the nice things about using a scripting language---such as
python or R---instead, is that your work becomes reproducible and you and
others can use your tricks again in the future!

Here we show you how you could do this exercise in R. Please play around first
and enjoy the struggle for a bit.

** installation
Install [[https://www.r-project.org/][R]] and [[https://rstudio.com/][RStudio]]. R is the programming language and RStudio is a friendly
graphical interface (or technically Integrated Development Environment) for R.

If you don't know how, you can follow many online guides, such as this [[https://courses.edx.org/courses/UTAustinX/UT.7.01x/3T2014/56c5437b88fa43cf828bff5371c6a924/][edX course]].
Note that for Mac users there are some additional installation steps required.

Install the required packages---extensions of R that make life even
easier!---by opening RStudio and going to the bottom-left panel (the terminal)
and typing, e.g.:

#+begin_src R :eval never
  install.packages("ggplot2")
#+end_src

Or, if you want to use ~ggplot2~, ~dplyr~, ~purrr~, etc., which I highly recommend,
install them all at once with:

#+begin_src R :eval never
  install.packages("tidyverse")
#+end_src

since they are part of the [[https://www.tidyverse.org/][tidyverse]], a collection of packages that makes R
amazing.

** load the libraries
These commands make the package functions available for use in your session:
#+begin_src R :results output
  library(readr)      # to read in the csv file (or use readxslx to read in excel files)
  library(ggplot2)    # for plotting
  library(patchwork)  # for composite plots
  library(dplyr)      # for tidy data manipulation
  library(tidyr)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example

Attaching package: ‘dplyr’

The following objects are masked from ‘package:stats’:

    filter, lag

The following objects are masked from ‘package:base’:

    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
#+end_example

** getting started
As a start, I highly recommend reading through the freely available book [[https://r4ds.had.co.nz/][R for
data science]] by Hadley Wickham. You can also try the datacamp [[https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r][Introduction to R]]
online course, which helped me get started initially. One last resource to get
you started is to install the package ~swirl~ and interactively learn the basics
right from R.

#+begin_src R :eval never
  install.packges("swirl")
  library(swirl)
  swirl()
#+end_src

** getting help
When you have problems or questions, have a look at any error messages if
present and consult the documentation of the function of interest with,
~?function_name~ or search for a topic with ~??topic~.

e.g., enter:
#+begin_src R :eval never
 ?ggplot
#+end_src
in the terminal.

+If+ When you have questions, search! This is not considered cheating!
[[https://stackoverflow.com/][StackOverflow]], your search engine, and sometimes even twitter ~#Rlang~ are your
friends!

* Practical 8
** read the data
I prepared a slightly cleaner CSV sheet, which we can read into R more easily. You can download it here:

See the end of the document for a copy-pastable version.

I rename some columns here so that I can type less and we don't have spaces in the column names.

#+begin_src R
  strat <- read_csv("biostrat_clean.csv", skip = 1) %>%
    rename(c(bio = "LOCAL BIOZONE", age = "NUMERICAL AGE in MA", loc = "LOCCODE", n_m12 = "N M12", N = "N of SPECIES",
           dry = "% DRY RODENTS", catholic = "% CATHOLIC", wet = "% WET RODENTS")) %>%
    select(-LOCCODE_1)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
Parsed with column specification:
cols(
  .default = col_double(),
  `LOCAL BIOZONE` = col_character(),
  LOCCODE = col_character(),
  LOCCODE_1 = col_character()
)
See spec(...) for full column specifications.
Warning message:
Duplicated column names deduplicated: 'LOCCODE' =
'LOCCODE_1' [64]
#+end_example

The output tells us how it read the csv file and what types each column was
identified as.

You can also read in the raw excel file directly with the package ~readxl~ if you
want.

** Graph of the species number per locality.
The first exercise is the easiest. We take our data ~strat~ and pipe it (~%>%~) to
the ~ggplot~ function. You can read this as: take ~strat~ and then do ~ggplot~ with
it.

Within the plot we specify so-called aesthetics with ~aes~. This links columns of
the data to things we can plot, in this case ~x~ and ~y~ for a simple scatter plot.
Because we are dealing with a time series (albeit a discontinuos one) it is
customary to plot the series with a line, which we add with ~geom_line~.

#+begin_src R :results graphics file :file n_spec.png :width 600
  strat %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = age, y = N)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(x = "Age (Ma)", y = "Number of species")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:n_spec.png]]

To learn more about creating plots with ~ggplot2~, I highly recommend following
the online course [[https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-visualization-with-ggplot2-1][data visualisation with ggplot2]] and [[https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html][chapter 3 of r4ds: data
visualisation]].

If you don't like the gray grid behind the data, have a look at ~?theme~. You can
easily change the plot to a black and white classical plot with a ~+
theme_classic()~ at the end.

** Graph of habitat preference
*** tidy the data
For this plot we need to re-arrange the data a little bit. Right now all the
percentages of the rodents are in different column. For easy plotting and data
processing, usually we want so-called ~tidy~ data. This means that each row
corresponds to one observation.

In this case that would mean we'd repeat the age and location code three times,
with one new variable ~percentage~ and another with the ~habitat~.

#+begin_src R :results none
  strat_hab <- strat %>%
    # remove all non-essential columns and rename for easy access
    select(age, loc, dry, catholic, wet) %>%
    # convert to long-format (this is something to look up and learn!)
    pivot_longer(cols = c(dry, catholic, wet), values_to = "percentage", names_to = "habitat")
#+end_src

To illustrate, we switch from:
#+begin_src R :exports results :results value :colnames yes
  strat %>%
    select(-c(D.hispanicus:`Ligerimys florancei`)) %>%  # remove some species to decrease the width
    head()  # head prints the first 6 rows
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

to:
#+begin_src R :exports results :results value :colnames yes
  head(strat_hab)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

read up on creating tidy data in [[https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html][r4ds chapter 12]].

*** create the plot
With the tidy data, creating an area chart is very easy:
#+begin_src R :results graphics file :file habitat_pref.png :width 600
  strat_hab %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = age, y = percentage, fill = factor(habitat, levels = c("dry", "catholic", "wet")))) +
    # this plots each line as a polygon
    geom_area() +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("dry" = "orange3", "catholic" = "brown4", "wet" = "blue4")) +
    labs(x = "Age (Ma)", y = "Abundance (%)", fill = "Habitat preference")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:habitat_pref.png]]

Here we adjust the colours manually. Note that generally it's not nice to use
manual colour scales because it's hard to estimate what colourblind people are
able to see well. In this case, with only 3 values and where specific colours
can make intuitive sense, I set it manually. I like to use
~viridis::scale_fill_viridis~ often!

Oh, and what does ~::~ mean you ask? It means: look in package ~viridis~ for the
function ~scale_fill_viridis~.

*** what's up at 16 Ma?
Notice the weird outlier near 16 Ma, where the total is larger than 100%!

Let's figure out which sample it is.

#+begin_src R :results value :colnames yes
  strat_hab %>%
    group_by(age, loc) %>%
    summarize(total = sum(percentage)) %>%
    # filter those rows where the percentage is not 100
    filter(total > 100 | total < 100)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
|   age | loc   | total |
|-------+-------+-------|
| 15.87 | COL-D |  99.8 |
| 15.89 | COL-C |   110 |

You will always have some noise in your data. With R, it's quite easy to drill
down into where it is and what causes it. Unfortunately, it won't stop you from
making mistakes in the first place 😉.

** Graph of Diversity and Equity
*** compute diversity and equity
Read the handout about how we calculate diversity and equity.

**** by column
We ~mutate_at~ here to do calculations for many columns. However, this is an
instance in which having this as tidy data would make some more complex examples
easier!

First we'll do the calculations in the way the dataframe is already set up.

#+begin_src R :results none
  strat_div <- strat %>%
    # first square all the species abundances
    mutate_at(vars(D.franconicus:Keramidomys), ~ . ^ 2) %>%
    # this overwrites the columns! use a named list if you want new columns in
    # stead. then calculate diversity and evennes
    mutate(diversity = 1 / (rowSums(select(., D.franconicus:Keramidomys), na.rm = TRUE)),
           evenness = diversity / N)
#+end_src

You don't have to understand all the steps here, since this is not the approach
I would recommend.
# new dplyr 1.0.0 syntax:
# mutate(diversity = 1 / (rowSums(across(D.franconicus_sq:Keramidomys_sq), na.rm = TRUE))) %>%
# evenness = diversity / `N of SPECIES`)

**** tidy
In stead, I would recommend to tidy your data as follows:

#+begin_src R
  tidystrat <- strat %>%
    # remove the columns we are not interested in
    select(-c(dry, catholic, wet, n_m12)) %>%
    # convert the species abundances to tidy format
    pivot_longer(D.franconicus:Keramidomys, names_to = "species", values_to = "abundance")

  ev <- tidystrat %>%
    # and for each age and locality, original row
    group_by(age, loc) %>%
    # calculate the diversity (be very careful where you place parentheses!)
    # notice that now we don't have to calculate the squares first.
    summarize(diversity = 1 / sum(abundance ^ 2, na.rm = TRUE),
              # calculate the number of species
              n_manual = sum(abundance > 0, na.rm = TRUE),
              # and for comparison get the ones from the original sheet
              n_from_sheet = mean(N, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    # calculate evenness
    mutate(evenness = diversity / n_manual)
#+end_src

While this is a little bit more code, I think it is more legible and it will
make the next steps easier.

Inspect ~tidystrat~ to see what it looks like!
#+begin_src R :results value :colnames yes
  head(tidystrat)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
| bio |   age | loc   | N | species        | abundance |
|-----+-------+-------+---+----------------+-----------|
| E   | 13.93 | LUM19 | 8 | D.franconicus  | nil       |
| E   | 13.93 | LUM19 | 8 | D.koenigswaldi | nil       |
| E   | 13.93 | LUM19 | 8 | D.larteti      | 4         |
| E   | 13.93 | LUM19 | 8 | D.hispanicus   | nil       |
| E   | 13.93 | LUM19 | 8 | D.moralesi     | nil       |
| E   | 13.93 | LUM19 | 8 | D.jordensi     | nil       |

Note that again the ~N of SPECIES~ in the original sheet is slightly different from our calculated one:
#+begin_src R :results value :colnames yes
  ev %>%
    filter(n_manual != n_from_sheet)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
|   age | loc   |            diversity | n_manual | n_from_sheet |             evenness |
|-------+-------+----------------------+----------+--------------+----------------------|
| 13.96 | LP4A  | 0.000346865721341954 |        8 |           10 | 4.33582151677443e-05 |
| 15.87 | COL-D | 0.000661489409554553 |       12 |           13 | 5.51241174628794e-05 |

*** create the plots
First we create the plot based on ~strat_div~, the original data with the new
columns for diversity and evenness. We create two separate plots and then add
them together as subplots using the package ~patchwork~. This is perfect when you
have to make many adjustments to your subfigures.

#+begin_src R :results graphics file :file diversity.png :width 600
  p_div <- strat_div %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = age, y = diversity)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(y = "Diversity")
  p_eq <- strat_div %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = age, y = evenness)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(y = "Evenness")
  # we use patchwork to put the two pluts together
  (p_div & theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_blank())) / p_eq + labs(x = "Age (Ma)")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:diversity.png]]

And to show that the tidy way results in the same plot, we tidy the data even
further and then using ~facets~.
#+begin_src R :results graphics file :file tidy_diversity.png :width 600
  ev %>%
    select(age, loc, diversity, evenness) %>%
    pivot_longer(diversity:evenness, names_to = "measure", values_to = "value") %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = age, y = value)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_grid(rows = vars(measure), scales = "free_y")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:tidy_diversity.png]]

* conclusion
This was a quick look into some of the features of ~R~ for data analysis and
plotting. I hope this will have peaked your interest and will get you to use
excel only as a way of entering data ;-).
